# MineSweeper
MineSweeper is a single player puzzle game. The purpose of the game is to clear the board from all hidden mines without detonating them.
<br>
My version of this game is a JavaFX Application for MidTerm project. 
Here is the description of the Application:

    First, you can select the level of the game from easy to extra hard:

After selecting the level you will be faced with the board(medium in the screenshot):

You can open any of the grids in the board by leftclicking your mouse, but be sure to not trap into mine.

You can mark suspicious grids with flags by rightclicking your mouse:

If you have enough flags around some grid with the number, you can open all remained grids around(be sure to flag proper grids, otherwise you will be trapped).
